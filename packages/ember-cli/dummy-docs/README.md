## Paragraphs

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

"Smartypants, double quotes" and 'single quotes'

## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~

## Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Nested Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
