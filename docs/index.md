# Introduction

Documentation is an essential part of any software today. Without documentation,
users are not able to take full advantage of projects. To allow developers and
teams to build documentation sites, having a powerful tool under the hood to help
them to deliver well-crafted documentation sites is the reason Docfy exists.

There are a lot of amazing tools out there for writing documentation sites; however,
most of them are specific to a framework without exposing any core functionality
for writing documentation sites for other frameworks or libraries.

A common use case for documentation sites is for demoing a component library or a
design system where you want to render your components in-place next to your markdown
content. Therefore, having the documentation site use the same framework or
libraries as your design system is essential for delivering a pleasant experience
to its users.

Docfy is modular such that it exposes its core functionality for building
documentation interfaces on top of it. Docfy also has some official libraries for
building documentation interfaces using [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com).

Docfy allows extending its core functionality by exposing a plugin system. It also
allows extending the markdown processor by using [remark](https://remark.js.org/)
under the hood. Remark has
[many plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/doc/plugins.md)
that can help you to extend and modify your markdown files.
